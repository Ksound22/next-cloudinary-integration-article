- Step 1: Clone the repo with HTTP or GitHub CLI
- Open your terminal and cd to the folder of the cloned project (it should be `next-active-link-next-layout-demo-main`)
- Copy the `sample.env` file as `env`, then add the appropriate values
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
